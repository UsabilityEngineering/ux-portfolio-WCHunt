# How Do You Like Your Toast?
## William Hunt - 3/10/20223 

I often enjoy having a simple breakfast in the mornings, especially if I can bundle all the food together and eat while on the move. The staple food that I use to make this as efficient as possible is toast. My personal preference for toast is when the bread is slightly crispy and the crust isn’t completely blackened, and I assume that most people might agree. This was never an issue I had until we got a brand new toaster my girlfriend had to have.

We used to have a Black & Decker toaster oven similar to the picture below ([picture taken from walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Black-Decker-4-Slice-Toaster-Oven/26854389)). I liked this model of toaster since I found it fairly straightforward to use and when trying to get my toast just right I could look at the timing knob and turn it to the picture of the half black toast and I knew what I would be getting once it dinged. This was a **matching between the system and real world**, a usability heuristic guideline, that allows a user to understand the expected outcome of using a product in a specific manner. I assumed that the new toaster would be similar, but that turned out to be wrong.

The new toaster we got is a Beautiful 2 slice toaster by Drew Barrymore. It’s a touch screen toaster and takes up less room than my previous toaster oven.  Overall, The new toaster (pictured below) has an **aesthetic and minimalist design**,  which is another of the usability heuristics, in that the design is slick, and the buttons only serve the purpose of providing a way to our desired outcome, without taking away from what we need to know to operate this toaster. The issue I have with this toaster is that unlike the toaster oven the only way to adjust the timing is by pressing the + or - buttons. The light goes up to seven bars and then you have to pull the handle down to start toasting your food. The other issue I have, although rather minor, is that I have to double check that the settings haven’t been altered between uses, as my girlfriend likes her toast and bagel’s crispy. A solution I thought of that could solve the problems I have with this toaster is that they simply add another button to the toaster for a user’s preset or just have a toast button that would adjust the timing. This would also allow for there to be an even number of buttons on each side of the touch screen.
